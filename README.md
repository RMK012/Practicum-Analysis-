# Practicum-Analysis
An investigation into the correlation between explorative behavior and stereotypical thinking, using Python and JASP for data analysis.
# Practicum Statement

**Supervisor:** Prof Moshe Bar

**Subject:** Investigating the connection between stereotypic thinking and the exploration-exploitation spectrum

The main goal of the project is to examine whether people who tend to be more explorative by their nature (i.e., willing to take more risks, have a more global attention, and tend to have divergent thinking rather than convergent) also tend to be less stereotypic when encountering people from their out-group.

The work is going to be conducted by recruiting subjects, conducting Implicit Associative Test (IAT) to test their level of stereotypical thinking, conducting experiments (Iowa Gambling Test-IGT, Navon task, AUT) to test their level on the exploration-exploitation spectrum, and analyzing the results in order to find a correlation between the two indices.
