### The Relationship Between Stereotypic Thinking and the Exploration-Exploitation Spectrum

#### Overview
This study investigates the link between stereotypic thinking and cognitive styles leaning towards exploration or exploitation. It aims to answer whether individuals with a more explorative cognitive style exhibit lower levels of stereotypic thinking when encountering out-groups.

#### Methodology
- **Participants**: 22 individuals (8 men, 14 women; 3 Arabs, 19 Jews; ages 18-30).
- **Design**: Remote experimental design with four computer-based tasks.
- **Tasks**: Implicit Association Test (IAT), Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Navon Task, and Alternative Uses Task (AUT).

#### Key Findings
- **IAT**: Varying levels of racial bias were observed across groups.
- **IGT and AUT**: No significant correlation with IAT results.
- **ANOVA**: Significant variations in divergent thinking but not in risk-taking behavior or focus level.

#### Conclusion
The study found no clear correlation between explorative cognitive styles and lower levels of stereotypic thinking. While cognitive flexibility varies among individuals, it does not reliably predict the extent of implicit biases. The study suggests the need for more nuanced methods and opens avenues for future research.
